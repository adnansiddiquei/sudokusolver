\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
    There are a variety of algorithms that can be used to solve sudoku puzzles, some very complex algorithms and some
    much simpler ones.
    Backtracking is an example of a much simpler, brute force algorithm.
    Simply put, backtracking works by visitng each cell in a sudoku grid one by one, filling numbers into the cells,
    and backtracking to previous cells if no valid number can be filled into the current cell.
    This is the algorithm that we chose to implement in this project, due to it's simplicity, as it would allow this
    report to focus on the software development process rather than the algorithm itself.

    In this report, we will discuss a variety of topics related to the software development process, starting from
    the solution design where we will discuss the prototyping involved.
    We will then discuss the development of the code which involves the tools, workflows and processes used to develop
    and optimise the code.
    We will then discuss unit testing and continuous integration, and finally we will discuss how we utilised
    documentation best practises and packaging tools.
