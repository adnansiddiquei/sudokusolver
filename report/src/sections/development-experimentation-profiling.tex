\section{Development, Experimentation and Profiling}\label{sec:development-experimentation-and-profiling}
Here we discuss several components of the development process, and reason why we chose to do things in certain ways

\subsection{Linting and Formatting - \inlinecode{ruff}}\label{subsec:linting-and-formatting}
    Linting and formatting is useful, especially in shared projects, as it allows for a consistent style across the codebase.
    There are a plethora of python linting and formatting tools available and for this project, we chose to use \inlinecode{ruff}.
    There were two primary reasons for this choice: speed and simplicity.
    \inlinecode{ruff} is faster than most other linting tools including \inlinecode{flake8}.
    In a test done by the developers of \inlinecode{ruff}, it managed to lint the CPython codebase 42x faster than
    \inlinecode{flake8} \cite{ruff-repo}.
    Whilst speed of linting is not a primary concern for this project, it doesn't hurt to pick the faster option.

    Additionally, \inlinecode{ruff} provides formatting functionality and as such it can also replace tools such as
    \inlinecode{black}.
    This makes the implementation of linting and formatting simpler, as we only need to use one tool.
    \inlinecode{ruff}'s configuration capabilities allow it to lint and format to any standard we want to, and as such,
    it was configured to mimic \inlinecode{black} and \inlinecode{flake8}'s default config in accordance with PEP8.

    \subsection{Git and Gitlab pipeline}\label{subsec:git-and-gitlab-pipeline}
    Why branches? Branch naming convention.
    Creating issues for tasks. Why? Project management. JIRA.
    New branch and merge per issue.
    Labels for issues because easy to and can folder the branches with those labels (show PyCharm example).

    \subsection{Test Driven Development}\label{subsec:test-driven-development}
    Explain why I wrote the tests first.

    \subsection{Profiling and Optimisation}\label{subsec:profiling-and-optimisation}
    Where did i test different packages for speed? Why did I choose numpy?
    Show how I profiled my code to identify where the bottleneck was.
    How did I work around this? Cython?

    \subsection{Coding Best Practises}\label{subsec:coding-best-practises}
    Modularisation.
    typing.
    Exceptions. Error handling, try except. Never catch all exceptions.
