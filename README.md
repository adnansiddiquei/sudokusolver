## <a name="run"></a> 1. Run `sudokusolver`
Clone the repository and then run
```bash
make run
```
in your terminal.

This will
1. Build the Docker image using the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
2. Run the Docker image, and mount `/sudokusolver/inputs` and `/sudokusolver/outputs` as volumes on the container, mapped
to the same directories on your local machine. The [input.txt](sudokusolver/inputs/input.txt) required for the coursework
is already in the `inputs` directory.
3. Open an interactive terminal in the Docker container.

Then run
```bash
conda activate as3438_c1cw
```
to activate the conda environment, and then
```bash
python -m sudokusolver sudokusolver/inputs/input.txt
```
to run the solver on the input file. This will output the result to `sudokusolver/outputs/output1.txt`.

To run the solver on different input files, add them to the `sudokusolver/inputs` directory and then run
```bash
python -m sudokusolver sudokusolver/inputs/<filename>.txt
```
replacing `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to run the solver on. The solver will then output the result to
`sudokusolver/outputs/output<X>.txt`, with `<X>` being the next available integer.

Unsolvable sudokus will not save an output to `sudokusolver/outputs/`. A message will be printed to the terminal indicating
that the sudoku is unsolvable.

Invalid sudokus also will not save an output to `sudokusolver/outputs/`. Instead, the relevant error will be raised by the
program. You will know that the error was raised by `sudokusolver` as the error message will be prefixed with the package
name, for example:

```
ValueError: (sudokusolver) Input file does not contain 9 rows of numbers. Please check the input file contains 9 rows of numbers, and is formatted correctly.
```

## <a name="docs"></a> 2. Documentation

make html
```
And then open `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser.

## <a name="report"></a> 3. Report
The report is located at [report/out/main.pdf](report/out/main.pdf).

## <a name="tests"></a> 4. Tests
Run
```bash
pytest
```
in the root directory to run the tests.
